## Data Protection Notes
This project processes information from publicly available Domestic Homicide Reviews (DHRs).  
Although published online by local authorities and the Home Office, these reports remain subject to data protection law as they contain personal and special category data.  

- **Controller**: City St George, University of London  
- **Purpose**: Scientific research in the public interest  
- **Lawful basis (Article 6, UK GDPR)**: Public task  
- **Special category condition (Article 9(2)(j))**: Research with appropriate safeguards  
- **Criminal offence data**: These reports may also contain information relating to criminal convictions and offences. Processing of such data is undertaken under the research provisions of the Data Protection Act 2018, with safeguards in place.  
- **Safeguards**: Data minimisation, no raw text in public repos, pseudonymisation, secure storage.  
- **Retention**: Raw reports are retained only for the duration of the project and stored in secure, access-controlled university systems. Derived, non-identifiable outputs may be retained for longer for reproducibility.  
- **Appropriate Policy Document**: Processing of special category and criminal offence data in this project is covered by City St Georgeâ€™s Appropriate Policy Document for research. For details, contact the University Data Protection Officer (ADD LINK).
